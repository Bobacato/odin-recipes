# odin-recipes

In this project, ill be building a basic recipie website, aiming to practice HTML elements ive used during the first bit of the odin project, the project will contain a main index page, and also links to different recipies

This is my first project on the Odin Project, and also my first project using Github, so some of my commits doesnt have updated code in it, as i didnt save the code! oops.. I have now learnt though! (i hope :0)
